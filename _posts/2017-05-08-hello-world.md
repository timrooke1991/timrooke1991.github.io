## Welcome to my blog!

My name is Tim. I am an avid Spurs fan. I previously worked at Unruly, an AdTech company, as a Product Manager. However, I have just started a full-time Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. In an effort to change careers, I am trying to re-train as a Web Developer – this probably will be what the majority of the blog is about.

I have messed around with coding before and have tried a few online Udemy courses alongside my work. These were good and allowed me to get a few projects under my belt. Also, my role as a Product Manager required me to write some code, fix some bugs and have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main problem I faced when trying to learn to code was finding the time. I wrote some code in my job, but not that regularly. Balancing a full-time job while trying to code in the evenings and weekends wasn’t working, which is why I started a full-time course at General Assembly.

I’ll hopefully be blogging semi-frequently on my thoughts, experiences, problems, and solutions as a newbie developer. I’ll also upload any of my projects to the site as well. As mentioned, the blog will be largely development focused with the occasional rant about Tottenham Hotspur as and when is appropriate.
