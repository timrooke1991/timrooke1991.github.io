##

This project was to build a Full Stake application, I chose to build a blogging platform coupled with IBM Watson's sentiment analysis API. This shows how negative or positive a post is. It also analyses comments on blog posts, and specific concepts mentioned within the blog post text.

##

The biggest challenge of the application was working with the API payload. This came in a large object, so I had toÂ plan what data I wanted to use and store this in the database. Once done, this allows me to access the data in a more manageable way, which made including this in my application easier.

##

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Refinement to styling and layouts
- Add global user concepts, e.g. across all the posts created by the user display the most commonly discussed topics.
- Allow users to select topics they were interested in and by default show them articles relating to these categories.
