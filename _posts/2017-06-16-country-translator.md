This is a simple command line tool that translates Country names from English to another chosen language. This is something that I required for a website that I was building, so spend some time converting it into a tool for others to use as well. The tool scrapes Wikipedia to get the required translation for 250 countries.

This tool utilises Wikipedia from translations, so makes the assumption that these translations are accurate.

Also, in the event a translation can not be found the program returns a string of 'not found'. Coverage does vary depending on the language requested.
