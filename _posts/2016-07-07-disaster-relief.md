### Description

The site is designed to enable individuals to respond to a tragedy by either posting for help needed or offering aid to those affected. Posts on the site are referred to as "campaigns".

Users can view campaigns without having to log in but are required to do so should they wish to respond to or start an individual campaign.

The site uses Google Maps API (Geolib and Autocomplete) to calculate distances between users.

Filter, search and sort functions enable users to refine the results by location, distance, and keywords.

### Approach

The team pair coded major tasks but small individual features were completed individually in order to save time. Merges were done daily and bug fixing sessions were pair coded for significant issues. Small bugs were fixed as and when they arose. Trello was used to manage specific tasks being split into backlog (desirable), backlog (essential), in progress, waiting to merge and merged.
