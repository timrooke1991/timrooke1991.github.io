This project was to build a JavaScript browser game, I chose to build a basic football management simulation game. The allows players to chose from a list of teams, select their starting line-ups and watch the game unfold. Players can make substitutions and edit formations mid-match in an effort to change the outcome of the match in their club's favour.

The biggest challenge of the game was the substitution functionality. I used a `player.playing` boolean to keep track of players that were on/off the pitch at any one time. Players who received an injury or red card would have their `player.playing` value set to false. Initially, I tried to use this attribute for substitutions as well. However, this didn't work.

To deal with substitutions effectively and communicate the different states that a player (red card, injured, substituted) could be in, using a reliance on a single boolean wasn't sufficient. Therefore, I added an additional key-value pair to every player, which kept track of their status during the game (red card, injured, subbed-on, subbed-off). The additional data that this key provided allowed the game to handle substitutions, red cards and injuries much more effectively.

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

- Adding an extra-time and penalties feature.
- Improvement to the UI, particularly team selection.
- Add additional data attributes to the player objects, e.g. heading, tackling, passing, which could determine a team's likelihood to score from a free kick or create chances.
- Display average overall values (e.g. attack, defence) for a team, so that users can see how teams compare to one another.
- Add namespacing.
