## A Bit About Myself

I'm 26, I live in London and am an avid Spurs fan. Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking and am an enthusiastic investor on the stock market. I write [Trader Tim's blog](https://www.tradertim.co.uk) on investing and trading, which donates 10% of profits from investments to charity.

## Before Coding

I’ve always loved finding the solutions to problems. At university, I gained experience problem-solving in a degree in Law before working at an AdTech company in product development. As a Product Manager at Unruly, I worked closely with Developers and worked on technical workstreams. For example, I managed projects involving algorithms, APIs and making applications compatible for mobile. This gave exposure to code, and how developers work. It was something that was really interesting to me. Therefore, alongside my full-time role at Unruly, I began coding. I did online courses, Codecademy and built some simple projects. The more coding I did, the more I was convinced that a career in development was right for me. The main problem I faced when trying to learn to code was finding the time. I wrote some code in my job, but not that regularly. Balancing a full-time job while trying to code in the evenings and weekends wasn’t working.

## Moving into Coding

While I was making some learning to code in my spare time, I wanted to learn more quickly. Therefore, I left my role at Unruly and accepted a place at General Assembly on the Web Development Immersive program. I loved the General Assembly course. The ability to code on a full-time basis was something that I had been wanting to do for a long time. Now, having finished the course, I secured a job at Bili - an online language exchange startup. As 1 of only 2 developers in the team, I am required write code for the entire tech stack, configure tooling and deal with DevOps.
